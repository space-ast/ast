**ast** (/æst/) is an open-source aerospace simulation algorithm library written in C++, providing computational foundations for space mission analysis and design.

*Precise as the stars, born for aerospace simulation*

[中文文档](README_zh.md)

## 🌟 Project Introduction

**ast** (/æst/) is an algorithm library focused on the aerospace simulation domain, providing modern C++ implementations of core algorithms including orbital mechanics, attitude control, and trajectory planning.

## 🚀 Core Features

### 🛰️ Algorithm Domains

- **Orbital Mechanics**: Two-body problem, orbit propagation, Lambert problem solving
- **Attitude Systems**: Quaternion operations, attitude dynamics, control algorithms
- **Coordinate Transformations**: ECI/ECF/LVLH and other coordinate system conversions
- **Environment Models**: Atmospheric density, gravity fields, solar radiation pressure
- **Numerical Methods**: Ordinary differential equation integration, linear algebra solvers

## 📦 Quick Start

### Requirements

- C++11 compatible compiler (GCC 5+, MSVC 2015+)
- [xmake 2.9+](https://xmake.io/)

### Building the Project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/space-ast/ast.git
cd ast
xmake
```

## 🎯 API Design Philosophy

### Naming Conventions
The project adopts the following naming conventions:

```cpp
// Namespace ast
namespace ast
{
    // ...
}

// Global functions - single 'a' prefix
aPropagateOrbit();
aSolveLambert();
aRotateQuaternion();

// Type aliases - 'A' prefix
typedef ast::OrbitPropagator    AOrbitPropagator;
typedef ast::AttitudeController AAttitudeController;

// Enums - 'E' and 'e' prefix
enum EFrame { eECI, eECEF }; 

// Constants - 'k' prefix
const kEps15 = 1e-15;
```
